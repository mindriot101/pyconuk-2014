Simon,

This could be fun. I don't have a particularly interesting use, but I think its impressive how widely used Python is within the science community. For me it means I rarely need to code in another language, as one can do almost everything in python. Reducing data, fitting models, making plots etc. Astropy might be worth a mention unless there is representation for it specifically. It looks to me to be the most organised and active astronomy specific Python module.

hi simon,

not sure they are particularly interesting but examples from me are:

* use of python to run MCMC chains, with interfaces written in C++ for the parts that need to run fast (I have 2 or 3 examples of this)

* python programmes to carry out maximum entropy-based Doppler imaging, again with heavy lifting implemented in C++

* python interface to allow easy access to ULTRACAM data
